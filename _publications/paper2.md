## Abstract
This paper proposes a novel method based on the language representation model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for Obstetric assistant diagnosis on Chinese obstetric EMRs (Electronic Medical Records). To aggregate more information for final output, an enhanced layer is augmented to the BERT model. In particular, the enhanced layer in this paper is constructed based on strategy 1(A strategy) and/or strategy 2(A-AP strategy). The proposed method is evaluated on two datasets including Chinese Obstetric EMRs dataset and Arxiv Academic Paper Dataset (AAPD). The experimental results show that the proposed method based on BERT improves the F1 score by 19.58% and 2.71% over the state- of-the-art methods, and the proposed method based on BERT and the enhanced layer by strategy 2 improves the F1 value by 0.7% and 0.3% (strategy 1 improves the F1 score by 0.68% and 0.1%) over the method without adding enhanced layer respectively on Obstetric EMRs dataset and AAPD dataset.
