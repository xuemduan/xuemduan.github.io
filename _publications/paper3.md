## Abstract
The development of hot fields of natural language processing such as information extraction, sentiment analysis and machine translation are inseparable from the support of semantic lexicon and semantic framework. Therefore, it is especially important to construct the modern Chinese common verbs semantic framework dictionary covering rich semantic knowledge. Based on the fusion of existing research results, this paper defines the lexical framework of verbs. According to the different roles of predicate, the semantic framework is divided into basic semantic framework and extended semantic framework. On the basis of large-scale lexical and thematic role labeling corpus, the semantics is used as the processing unit, and the basic semantic framework and extended semantic framework are automatically extracted and summarized, supplemented by manual proofreading, and a complete and simplified version of the verb-word framework is constructed. The constructed lexical framework of the verb has been produced in a scale, which contains a detailed
description of the semantic framework of 2782 commonly used verbs (4516 meanings) and corresponding example sentences.
