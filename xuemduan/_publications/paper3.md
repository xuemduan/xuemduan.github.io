## Abstract
Semantic lexicon and semantic frame work are the primary support of natural language procesing tasks such as information extraction, sentiment analysis,and machine translation. Therefore,it is essential to construct the contemporary Chinese common verbsâ€™ semantic framework dictionary that covers rich semantic knowledge. Based on an analysis of curent research results, this paper defines the lexical framework of common Chinese verbs. Acording to the predicate the maticroles,the semantic framework is divided into the basic semantic framework and extended semantic framework. Frameworks which are automatically extracted, taking semantics as the procesing unit, and summarized based on large-scalel exical and thematic roles labeling corpus. The complete and simplified versions of the verb framework is constructed with the help of manual profreading. The final verb framework contains a detailed description and coresponding example sentences of 2,782 common verbs with 4,516 meanings.
