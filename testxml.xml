  <abstract>A proposal to provide RDF interpretation for XML</abstract>

  <section caption="Introduction">

     <p>The goal of this proposal is to facilitate the use of RDF mechanisms
        to access the information contained in a broad range of XML documents.</p>

     <p>It builds upon a <a href="syntax.html">simplified syntax</a> for RDF,
        but has a <em>broader</em> scope.</p>
